# OS-Kernel

This is a 32-bit kernel I am working on. It is made in the C programming language. For the bootloader, I use **GNU GRUB**.

This os has no filesystem and it only has a few basic commands:

echo 
info 
clear 
help

To compile this OS, you need the **i386-elf-gcc** cross-compiler. Then run:

```bash
make
